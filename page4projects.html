        <h4><p style="color: white;">Generative AI can, through deep fakes, create fake images of real people designed to look real even though they’re fake. Generative AI can now create images within minutes/seconds that look and sound as though they’re real and spread on the internet to disinform millions.</p></h4>

        <br>
        <h4><p style="color: white;"><h4><p style="color: white;">To stop the spread of disinformation, we should stop believing things we see from random accounts on social media. No matter if they’re verified or not, only direct sources should be trusted. For example, CNN won’t create a deep fake of Joe Biden going on a racist rant when asked about immigration to America. As unbelievable as a video like that may sound, a good-quality deep fake could probably still fool a good amount of people who have opposing views to him/hate Biden.</p></h4></p></h4>
